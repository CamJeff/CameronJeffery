        <!-- Project 1: Microwave-based imaging -->
        <article class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <h3>Microwave-Based Imaging for Bladder State Detection (March 2024-Present)</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 6px;">
            Supervised by <a href="https://www.emtlab.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Emily Porter</a>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The entire lab is centered around developing microwave-based medical technologies (both for imaging, and for treatment 
              techniques such as ablation). We like microwave radiation for imaging since it's non-ionizing, very inexpensive, 
              easy to use, and comfortable for the patient.
            </li>
            <li>The project I worked on involved developing a wearable path antenna array that is able to detect 
              the state of the bladder (is it full or empty). The idea for this was spurred from a charity approaching our 
              lab that deals with children with ASD/IDD that may experience urinary incontinence. The aim of the antenna device 
              is to let users know when their bladder is full and they have to use the bathroom (or 'void').
            </li>
            <li>Started with one wearable antenna and optimized the dimensions and geometry by assessing the S11 parameter loss.</li>
            <li>This then slowly build to an antenna array with more complex and realistic computational 3D phantoms of the pelvis, 
              derived from CT scans of real patients.
            </li>
            <li>Also investigated other non-wearable antennas such as a Vivaldi design, which is said to be more directive, 
              and thus can resolve the signal difference more clearly between full and empty bladders.
            </li>

        <!-- Project 2: Dose surface mapping -->
        <article class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <h3>Dose Surface Mapping of the Parotid Glands (Sept. 2025-Present)</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 6px;">
            Supervised by <a href="https://kildealab.com/author/john-kildea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. John Kildea</a>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>This a project I recently started for my undergraduate thesis. The motivation comes from the fact 
              that patients who undergo offline adaptive radiation therapy to treat cancer of the head and neck 
              can often experience side effects. One of which is a loss of function of parotid glands, the structure 
              responsible for producing saliva, in a condition known as xerostomia or dry mouth.
            </li>
            <li>We want to develop a predictive dose surface mapping software, in that we can visualize exactly where the radiation 
              does goes in the parotid gland during treatment. The dose surface maps is meant to produce a 2D image over the 
              structure of interest after it has been "flattened out". 
            </li>
            <li>For the parotid glands, we aim to look at dose surface maps for concentric spherical shells (like an onion) 
              after they have flattened (distortion is inevitable, but we can also quarter the parotids as well).
            </li>
            <li>Work on this project is still in early stages, but now I am testing on very simple spherical computational 
              phantoms that I made myself (with fake dose information also given by me). We will soon move to more 
              anatomically accurate models.
