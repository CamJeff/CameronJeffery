        <li>The number of trains arriving on days $1$, $2$, and $3$ are independent of the number of trains arriving on day $0$. Let $N_t$ denote the total number of trains that arrive after $t$ days. Then $N_t$ is a Poisson random variable with parameter $\lambda t=3t$, and we have:</li>

            \begin{align*}
        \mathbb{P}(N_4-N_1=0 \;|\; N_1=1) & = \mathbb{P}(N_4-N_1=0)=\mathbb{P}(N_3=0)

        <li>The number of trains arriving in the first $2$ days is independent of the number of trains arriving on day $4$. Therefore, we have:</li>

        <li>The game lasts exactly one hour, and you are presented with a button that you press only when you hear the bell ring. You are allowed to press the button only once during the hour-long game. </li>
        <li>You win the game if you press the button before the one-hour time limit is up and, you press the button on the bell's <em>last ring of the game</em>. Meaning, the bell should no longer ring for the rest of the game after you press the button.</li>
        <li>If before the one-hour mark the bell rings even once after you have pressed the button, you lose the game. </li>

    <ol class="parts" type="a">
        <li>Let $N_t$ be the number of fish caught after $t$ hours. Then, $N_t$ is a Poisson random variable. The probability that there are no arrivals in two hours is given as:</li>
        \begin{align*}
        \mathbb{P}(N_2=0)=\frac{e^{-0.6(2)}(0.6(2))^0}{0!}=\boxed{e^{-1.2}}
    \end{align*}
    
        <li>This is the probability of zero arrivals between time $0$ and $2$, and of at least
one arrival between time $2$ and $5$. Since these two intervals are disjoint, the desired
probability is the product of the probabilities of these two events, by independence, and so we have:</li>

\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{P}(N_2=0\cap N_5-N_2\geq 1) & = \mathbb{P}(N_2=0)\mathbb{P}(N_5-N_2\geq 1)
    \\ & = \mathbb{P}(N_2=0)\mathbb{P}(N_3\geq 1)
    \\ & = \mathbb{P}(N_2=0)\left[1-\mathbb{P}(N_3=0)\right]
    \\ & = e^{-0.6(2)}\left[1-e^{-0.6(3)}\right]
    \\ & =\boxed{e^{-1.2}-e^{-3}}
\end{align*}

            <li>If he catches at least two fish, he must have fished for exactly two hours. Hence,
the desired probability is equal to the probability that the number of fish caught in the
first two hours is at least two:</li>

\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{P}(N_2\geq 2) & = 1-\mathbb{P}(N_2< 2)
    \\ & = 1-\mathbb{P}(N_2=0)-\mathbb{P}(N_2=1)
    \\ & = 1-e^{-0.6(2)}-\frac{e^{-0.6(2)}(0.6(2))^1}{1!}
    \\ & = \boxed{1-2.2e^{-1.2}}
\end{align*}

        <li>The expected number of fish caught is equal to the expected number of fish caught during the first two hours, which is $2\lambda=2\cdot0.6=1.2$, plus the expectation of the number $\mathcal{N}$ of fish caught after the first two hours. $\mathcal{N}=0$ if he stops fishing at two hours, whereas $\mathcal{N}=1$ if he continues fishing beyond the two hours. The event $\mathcal{N}=1$ occurs if any only if no fish are caught in the first two hours, so we have:

        $$\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{N}]=1\times\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{N}=1)=\mathbb{P}(N_2=0)=e^{-0.6(2)}=e^{-1.2}$$

        <p>Thus, the expected number of fish caught is:</p>

        </li>

        $$\boxed{1.2+e^{-1.2}\;\text{fish}}$$

        <li>Given that he has been fishing for $4$ hours, the future fishing time is the time until the first fish is caught. By the memoryless property of the Poisson process, the future time is exponential, with mean $\frac{1}{\lambda}$. Hence, the expected total fishing time is:</li>

        $$4+\frac{1}{0.6}=\boxed{\frac{17}{3}\;\text{hours}}$$

      <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Solution</h3>

      
    <ol class="parts" type="a">
        <li>Let $\lambda=2$ be the Poisson rate parameter of Bob finding Netflix movies, and $\mu=4$ be the Poisson rate parameter of Joe finding Amazon Prime Video movies. The event that exactly one Amazon Prime Video movie arrival occurs before the first Netflix movie arrival is equivalent to the event that among all movie arrivals, the first movie is an Amazon Prime Video movie, and the second movie is a Netflix movie. The probability of this event equals:</li>

        $$\frac{\lambda\mu}{(\lambda+\mu)^2}=\frac{(2)(4)}{(2+4)^2}=\boxed{\frac{2}{9}}$$

        <li><strong><em>Method 1:</em></strong> Denote $T$ as the first Netflix movie arrival time. The conditional distribution of $X$ given $T$ is Poisson distributed with parameter $\mu T$, where $\mu=4$. So we have:

            $$\mathbb{P}(X=1|T)=\mu T e^{-\mu T}\;\;\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\;\;\mathbb{E}(X|T)=\mu T$$

            Combining this with the fact that as the inter-arrival times are exponential distributed with parameter $\mu$, i.e $T\sim \text{Exp}(\mu)$, we obtain:

            $$\mathbb{P}(X=1)=\mathbb{E}\left[\mu T e^{-\mu T}\right]=\mu \int_0^{\infty} te^{-\mu t}\lambda e^{-\lambda t}dt=\frac{\lambda\mu}{(\lambda+\mu)^2}$$

            <p>And so:</p>

            $$\mathbb{E}[X]=\mu \mathbb{E}[T]=\frac{\mu}{\lambda}=\frac{4}{2}=\boxed{2\;\text{Amazon Prime Video Movies}}$$

            <strong><em>Method 2:</em></strong> We can imagine that all arrivals of movies forms a Bernoulli sequence of trials, where a success is when Bob finds a Netflix movie. Denoting $X$ as the number of movies Joe finds on Amazon Prime Video before the first Netflix movie found by Bob, we can say that $X+1$ denotes the number of all trials up to and including the first successful one. Therefore:

                $$X+1\sim \text{Geom}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu}\right)$$

    And thus yields:

    $$\mathbb{E}[X]=\frac{\mu}{\lambda}=\frac{4}{2}=\boxed{2\;\text{Amazon Prime Video Movies}}$$
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong><em>Method 1:</em></strong> Denote the event $N_3$ at the time when Bob is ready to watch a movie on Netflix and $A_2$ as the time when Joe is ready to watch a movie on Amazon Prime Video. These two random variables with $N_3\sim \text{Gamma}(3,\lambda)$ and $P_2\sim \text{Gamma}(2,\mu)$, where $\lambda=2$ for Bob, and $\mu=4$ for Joe, as the parameters for each of their movie-searching Poisson process. The desired probability equals:

                \begin{align*}
        \mathbb{P}(N_3< A_2) & =\int_0^{\infty}\int_x^{\infty} f_{N_3}(x)f_{A_2}(y)dydx
        \\ & = \frac{\lambda^3\mu^2}{2}\int_0^{\infty}x^2e^{-\lambda x}dx\int_x^{\infty} ye^{-\mu y}dy
        \\ & = \frac{\lambda^3}{2}\int_0^{\infty}x^2(\mu x+1)e^{-(\lambda+\mu)x}dx
        \\ & = \frac{\lambda^3(\lambda+4\mu)}{(\lambda+\mu)^4}
        \\ & = \frac{(2)^3(2+4\cdot4)}{(2+4)^4}
        \\ & =\boxed{\frac 19}  
    \end{align*}

    <strong><em>Method 2:</em></strong> We can apply the fact that the streaming services (Netflix and Amazon Prime Video) corresponding to the particular arrivals of movies are independent and identically distributed: each potential movie corresponds to Netflix with probability $\lambda/(\lambda+\mu)$ and Amazon Prime Video with probability $\mu/(\lambda+\mu)$, where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Poisson parameters for Netflix and Amazon Prime Video respectively. 

    <p>The event that they watch a movie on Netflix corresponds to the each of the possible sequences of movie arrivals:</p>

    $$\text{NNN},\;\;\text{ANNN},\;\;\text{NANN},\;\;\text{NNAN}$$

    Where N is a Netflix movie arrival, and A is a Amazon Prime Video arrival. So the desired probabiliy equals:

    $$\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu}\right)^3+3\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu}\right)^3\left(\frac{\mu}{\lambda+\mu}\right)=\frac{\lambda^3(\lambda+4\mu)}{(\lambda+\mu)^4}=\frac{(2)^3(2+4\cdot4)}{(2+4)^4}=\boxed{\frac 19}$$
        </li>

        <li>Denote the event $N_3$ at the time when Bob is ready to watch a movie on Netflix and $A_2$ as the time when Joe is ready to watch a movie on Amazon Prime Video. The time needed to find a movie is the minimum of the random variables $N_3$ and $A_2$. </li>
